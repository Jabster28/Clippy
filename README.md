## **Todo:**

```
- Figure out why node gyp wont build some packages
// It didnt build because xcode command line tools weren't enabled,
// to enable them install xcode and do: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

- Add minimize option to the copytable view

- IMPORTANT: Add ability for image copies to show on the table

- Add Feature to connect Clippy to a backend server to access clipboard datafrom anywhere
```
