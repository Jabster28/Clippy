- [x] Figure out why node gyp wont build some packages

// It didnt build because xcode command line tools weren't enabled,
// to enable them install xcode and do: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

- [x] Add minimize option to the copytable view
  // Added in v(a0.74.9)

- [ ] IMPORTANT: Add ability for image copies to show on the table

- [ ] Add Feature to connect Clippy to a backend server to access clipboard datafrom anywhere
   // This feature is being worked on [here](https://github.com/Jarmahent/ClippyBackEnd)
